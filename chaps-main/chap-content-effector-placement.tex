\chapter{Foot Placement Optimisation} \label{chap:optimisation}
This chapter describes the processes necessary for optimising the foot end positions, starting by describing the method of scoring the heightmap generated in
chapter \ref{chap:mapping}. Next a semi radial search algorithm for use in locating the position with the best score. Finally the process of choosing a reference
floor height based on the terrain is described.
\section{Overview}
    The best possible anchor points for the supporting feet, given an initial point from the walking
    gait state machine, must be found based on the heightmap. This is achieved by assigning a walkability score to each cell in the heightmap based on the
    cells slope and its proximity to edges.

    To find the first, best foot end position relative to the nominal foot end position, a semi radial search algorithm is used

    Finally, since the robot will be walking over terrain it is required to adjust its reference for the floor height.

\section{Scoring} \label{sec:scores}
    The scores considered are the slope and proximity scores. The slope score aims to reject points with high slopes while the proximity score rejects points close
    to other parts of the terrain with steep inclines, i.e. to reject points inside holes or close to ledges.
    \subsection{Slope Score}
        The slope score is simply taken as the slope of the terrain at the current point. The aim of this score is to prevent the robot from slipping due to
        selecting anchor points with too steep of a slope.
        
        As the heightmap slope is not defined by a known function, the slope is calculated using the Sobel
        operator (\cite{sobel2014}), a combination of a central finite difference and a smoothing operator.

        Equation \ref{eq:sobelgx} and \ref{eq:sobelgy} describe the two separable x and y direction kernels, \(G_x\) and \(G_y\),
        of the Sobel operator. These kernels are a combination of central finite difference and smoothing operator, see Appendix \ref{app:sobel} 
        for a breakdown. Equation \ref{eq:sobelsg} combines \(G_x\) and \(G_y\) to produce the slope score, \(S_g\). Note that these equations represent
        a single scalar result of the Sobel operator using the Frobenius inner product, \cite{horn2012matrix}. If evaluated over the whole heightmap this is equivalent
        to convolution.

            \begin{split} \label{eq:sobelgx}

        with \(C_g\) being the weighting constant associated with the slope score, \(S_g\).

        \end{figure}

    \subsection{Edge Proximity Score}
    The proximity score aims to bias the selected anchor point away from points near steep inclines in the terrain. This score is defined as the average of the height
    difference of the current point weighted by the gaussian kernel \(\boldsymbol{K}\), of size \(n\) by \(n\). The distance around inclines that is rejected depends on the the
    chosen size of the kernel \(\boldsymbol{K}\), the standard deviation of \(\boldsymbol{K}\) and the height differences. This score is described in Equation
    \ref{eq:terrain_prox}.

    \begin{equation} \label{eq:terrain_prox}
        S_p(x,y) = C_p\left|\frac{\sum\left\langle\boldsymbol{K},(\boldsymbol{h}_{i,j}-\boldsymbol{h}_{x,y})\right\rangle _{\mkern-3mu F}}{n^2}\right|
    \end{equation}

    \noindent
    where,
    \[i = \big[\mkern-4.7mu\big[x- \lfloor\tfrac{1}{2}n\rfloor,\mkern2mu x+\lfloor\tfrac{1}{2}n\rfloor\big]\mkern-4.7mu\big]\]
    \[j = \big[\mkern-4.7mu\big[y-\lfloor\tfrac{1}{2}n\rfloor,\mkern2mu y+ \lfloor\tfrac{1}{2}n\rfloor\big]\mkern-4.7mu\big]\]
    
    
    \noindent
    with \(x\) and \(y\) being the indices of the cell whose score is currently being evaluated, \(\boldsymbol{h}\) the
    heightmap and \(C_p\) the score's weighting constant.
    
    A diagrammatic, sliced, representation of the proximity score can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:prox_score_diagram}. The
    slice is taken along the x axis of the heightmap.

        \caption{Proximity Score Diagrammatic Representation}
        \label{fig:prox_score_diagram}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Constraints}
    It is important to constrain the possible anchor points to confer to the stability triangle,
    meaning that the centre of mass of the robot must be inside the triangle formed by the three
    anchor points. Additionally, it is important that the points selected are not too far away,
    both in the horizontal and vertical direction for the robot to reach.


\section{Score Search Algorithm} \label{sec:radial_search}
    Once the heightmap has been processed into the score map, which is done by adding the
    slope score and terrain proximity score, the point with the best score must be found for every
    initial anchor point.
    The resolution of the heightmap is not very high and the adjusted anchor point is not
    allowed to deviate too far from the initial anchor point, additionally due to the parallel nature
    of the heightmap generation it is possible to score the entire heightmap with minimal cost.
    Thus, it was decided to not employ an optimisation algorithm, such as gradient decent or
    Bayesian, but rather to use a radial search algorithm. This algorithm progressively expands
    its searching radius over the square score grid until a valid score is found, at which point it
    terminates, thus ensuring that the closest valid point to the initial anchor point is selected.
    See Figure \ref{fig:score_search} for a diagram representing the search pattern for a 5 grid squares search area.
    Note that this search pattern will become inaccurate for large search areas, as the pattern steps
    in a square manner. This however is not much of a concern for smaller search areas.

    \captionsetup[figure]{oneside,margin={0cm,0cm}}
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics{search_diagram.pdf}
        \caption{Radial search, shown for a 5 cell search diameter.}
        \label{fig:radial_search}
    \end{figure}

    \section{Floor Height Adjustment} \label{sec:height_adjust}
    After the horizontal position of the feet have been optimised, the height of the foot is simply set to the height of the
    terrain at the target horizontal coordinates. This ensures that the robots body remains level and at a constant global height.

    It is however important to adjust the reference floor height that the robot uses, if this is not done, then the robot will be
    incapable of surmounting terrain higher than its commanded standing height, as the robot will simply maintain said height and walk into the tall terrain.
    There are various methods to choosing a floor height, from using 
    a time of flight sensor underneath the robots main body to using height data from the heightmap.

    The method that was implemented in this paper uses the average of three highest target positions out of all the robots legs.
    This allows the robot to preemptively increase ore decrease its floor hight as it targets to step onto higher or lower terrain.

    \captionsetup[figure]{oneside,margin={0cm,0cm}}
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Diagrams-FloorHeight .drawio.pdf}
        \caption{Floor height diagram.}
        \label{fig:floor_height}
    \end{figure}

    While this method works well to preemptively adjust height and to optimise the body height against foot height, it does present one problem. If there is a tall piece of terrain in the path of the robots body
    without any feet positioned on it, then the robot will not adjust its body height to clear this piece of terrain. 
    Thus, the bounding box of the robots body, excluding the legs and feet, is checked against the heightmap
    and if anywhere in the bounding box is higher than the previously set floor height, the floor height is adjusted to this new value.

    \section{Scoring Test} \label{sec:test_scores}
    For testing the walkability scores described in section \ref{sec:scores}, a piece of terrain that demonstrates various types of obstacles
    that the robot might encounter was chosen, this terrain and its heightmap is shown in figure \ref{fig:score_test_map}.
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[height=.8\linewidth, left]{hmap3D.png}
            \caption{3D Terrain}
            \label{fig:sub_3d_terrain}
        \end{subfigure}%
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

            \caption{Heightmap of 3D Terrain}
            \label{fig:sub_3d_terrain_hmap}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{3D Model of Terrain and its heightmap.}
        \label{fig:score_test_map}
    \end{figure}

    \noindent
    The heightmap in figure \ref{fig:sub_3d_terrain_hmap} is used to test the various walkability scores, first, in order to show individual results,
    the slope and edge proximity score is applied to the heightmap separately from each other, this is shown in figure \ref{fig:scores_seperate}. Next the combined score is
    shown in figure \ref{fig:full_score}, this is the score that is used to optimise foot end positions.
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[height=.85\linewidth, left]{slopeScoreTest.png}
            \caption{Slope score test.}
            \label{fig:sub_slope_test}
        \end{subfigure}%
        \begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[height=.85\linewidth, right]{proxScoreTest.png}
            \caption{Edge proximity score test.}
            \label{fig:sub_prox_test}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Slope score and edge proximity score tests.}
        \label{fig:scores_seperate}
    \end{figure}
    The slope score can be seen in figure \ref{fig:sub_slope_test}, from this it can be seen that the slope score successfully indicates sloped areas
    as less suitable foot end positions. It is also clear that vertical inclines are strongly discouraged, and while not the primary purpose of the slope
    score, this is expected and does not have a negative impact on scoring.

    Figure \ref{fig:sub_prox_test} shows that edge proximity score successfully discourages foot placement in areas with large height deviations,
    while allowing placement in areas with a locally similar slope, such as the ramp in the bottom-right. As can be seen from the larger, and more intense, discourage areas around the boxes in the
    top-right, bottom-right, left and bottom-left, it is clear that the magnitude of the height differential will increase the size and strength of the rejection area.
    Next, in figure \ref{fig:full_score} the combined slope and edge proximity scores can be seen. This is simply a weighted addition of the two scores.
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.49\textwidth]{fullScore.png}
        \caption{Full walkability score.}
        \label{fig:full_score}
    \end{figure}

    \noindent
    Finally, the radial search algorithm described in section \ref{sec:radial_search} is used to optimise various nominal foot end positions.
    This is shown in figure \ref{fig:optimisation_test}.
    \newpage
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{scoreTestFinal.png}
        \caption{Walkability score optimisation test.}
        \label{fig:optimisation_test}
    \end{figure}

    \noindent
    If the nominal foot position is in an acceptable position, the position will not be further optimised, this can be seen with the left most
    nominal position in figure \ref{fig:optimisation_test}. If however the nominal position is too close to an edge, such as with the top-right example, 
    the nominal position is optimised to the closest acceptable position. The optimised position does not need to have a perfect score, as can be seen in the bottom-right example, this example is similar to 
    the aforementioned top-right, but it adjusts onto the ram, which has a non-perfect, however acceptable, walkability score.
    Next the right most example shows how the nominal position is place on a piece of terrain that is too steep, this it is optimised onto the flat surface on top of the round pedestal. 
    
    % \noindent
    Finally, the top-left and bottom-left examples show the case of a nominal position placed on a sloped pillar and a sloped hole respectively.
    In both cases the nominal position is optimised to the flat surface at the to of the pillar and at the bottom of the hole.
    
    The flat surfaces on the pillar an in the hole are large enough to not be rejected by the edge proximity score, however, if the inclines sere steeper or the flat surface smaller it is possible that these nominal positions would be
    unsolvable, as there is no appropriate foot end placement inside the search radius. In this case the robot would need to make a course adjustment.

    \newpage
    \subsection{Hardware Scoring Test}
        Using the same colour scheme as above, the hardware heightmap found in section \ref{sec:hardware_hmap} is shown in figure \ref{fig:harware_hmap}. The scoring system is then
        applied to this heightmap as shown in figure \ref{fig:hardware_score_map}.
        \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}
                \includegraphics[height=.95\linewidth, left]{hardware_map.png}
                \caption{Hardware heightmap}
                \label{fig:harware_hmap}
            \end{subfigure}%
            \begin{subfigure}{.45\textwidth}
                \includegraphics[height=.95\linewidth, right]{score_test_hardware.png}
                \caption{Score applied to hardware heightmap.}
                \label{fig:hardware_score_map}
            \end{subfigure}
            \caption{Heightmap generated from hardware and the corresponding score map.}
            \label{fig:hardware_hmap_scoremap}
        \end{figure}

        \noindent
        As can be seen from figure \ref{fig:hardware_hmap_scoremap} the scoring system applied to the hardware generated heightmap generates
        similarly to when it is applied to a ideal heightmap. The primary difference that should be noted is the score artifacts created around
        the mapped areas edge, seen as a outline around the mapped area. Additionally to the outline around the mapped area, within the mapped area
        light score lines can be seen. These lines are most clear on the portion of flat terrain. The lines are created by the moving field of vision
        and inaccuracies in the position, mostly height, estimation, as explained previously in section \ref{sec:hardware_hmap}.

        It should also be noted that while the score for the sloped plane at the top of the heightmap is not as even as it was in the ideal heightmap,
        even with these undulations present it is still sufficiently accurate for the correct foot position correction to be mad.
        This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hardware_test_points} which shows a couple of nominal test points applied to the hardware generated score map.

        \newpage
        \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{score_test_hardware_points.png}
            \caption{Test points on hardware score map.}
            \label{fig:hardware_test_points}
        \end{figure}

        \noindent
        As expected, the test points applied to the hardware score map behaves similarly the the ideal case shown in figure \ref{fig:optimisation_test},
        with all the nominal points being adjusted to appropriate new positions. Note the point applied to the sloped plane at the top of the map is adjusted
        appropriately even with the slightly undulating score map across the sloped area.

        Additionally, it should be noted that while some of the outlining artifacts do grow large enough to affect the final foot positions, as can be seen in the
        left most test point, these effects are generally not large enough to warrant concern.
